## Phase1
As part of Phase 1 of my Electronics II course project at Sharif University of Technology, I worked on the design and simulation of the input stage of the 741LM operational amplifier. This phase focused on analyzing the fundamental parameters of operational amplifiers, such as gain, input/output resistance, frequency response, common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), and slew rate. By studying the 741LM datasheet, I identified its pin configuration, operating voltage, power consumption, and input bias currents, forming a basis for theoretical and practical analysis. Using DC and AC simulations, I determined the transistor operating points, extracted small-signal parameters, and evaluated the amplifier’s frequency response, ensuring it met design requirements.  
Since this is only Phase 1 of a larger project, the focus was on designing and verifying the input stage of the amplifier rather than the entire system. I worked on meeting key design specifications, including achieving a 50dB voltage gain, an input impedance greater than 2MΩ, and power consumption below 12mW. Additionally, I explored transient behavior, studied slew rate limitations, and investigated DC offset compensation techniques. This phase provided valuable hands-on experience in analog circuit design, simulation tools, and semiconductor device behavior, laying the groundwork for further stages of the project, which will expand on additional amplifier stages and overall system integration.


## Phase2
In Phase 2 of my Electronics II course project at Sharif University of Technology, I designed and simulated a high-gain power amplifier with an output stage capable of driving a load. Building on the previous phase, this stage focused on enhancing gain, improving linearity with feedback, and addressing limitations such as the dead zone in the class B output stage. By analyzing the circuit’s output swing, distortion, and common-mode range, I implemented design modifications to optimize performance.  

To improve efficiency, I optimized transistor operating points, replaced independent sources with current mirrors, and integrated a folded cascode input stage for better gain and dynamic range. Using LTspice simulations, I validated the amplifier’s closed-loop gain, swing, and power consumption, ensuring it met design specifications. This phase deepened my knowledge of power amplification, feedback control, and analog circuit design, laying the foundation for more advanced applications in integrated circuit development.
